# meanFromScratch
A MEAN stack application and a very suitable starter seed

##Documentation

This is a project just for creating a MEAN app architecture by my preferences.

##Notes

I am using a [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) for code styling and WebStorm 2016 IDE.
- [Configure Standard with WebStorm](https://github.com/feross/standard/blob/master/docs/webstorm.md)

Angular 1.5.8

Node v7.0.0

Tried to include some Es6 standards.

Per type architecture used.

DO NOT forget to :
- replace your db configurations in config/db.js 
- replace current session module for production use


## Installation

1. Clone/Download repository
2. `npm install` - to install node package dependencies
3. `bower install` - to install bower dependecies
4. Run server.js file and you are done ! ( localhost:8081 is available ) 

## TODOS:
- implement JSON web tokens authentication
- improve client-side
- do black-box todo`s(eg: implement proper error handlers)
